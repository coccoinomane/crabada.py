# = DONATE =

# Building and maintaining the bot requires time and
# passion: please consider expressing your gratitude by
# donating a small part of your rewards :-)
#
# Use this parameter to donate a % of your rewards to the project's
# wallet (0xb697fAC04e7c16f164ff64355D5dCd9247aC5434).
# For example, setting DONATE_PERCENTAGE=5 will donate 5%.
# Set it to 0 or remove the line to never donate.
#
# WHAT ABOUT GAS?
# The donation will be sent only once every 10 times the bot claims
# a reward. This means that you will be spending only about 1 or 2%
# more of what you already spend for gas, regardless of the donation
# amount.
