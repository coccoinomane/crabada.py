# Building and maintaining the bot requires time and
# passion: please consider expressing your gratitude by
# donating a small part of your rewards :-)
#
# Use this parameter to donate a % of your rewards to the project's
# wallet (0xb697fAC04e7c16f164ff64355D5dCd9247aC5434).
# For example, setting DONATE_PERCENTAGE=5 will donate 5%.
# Set it to 0 or remove the line to never donate.
#
# WHAT ABOUT GAS?
# Sending a donation costs 0.21 TUS in gas. Also, to optimize gas,
# a is sent only once every 10 times the bot claims a reward for
# you. This means that the gas impact of donations is less than 1%
# of what you already spend for gas, regardless of the donation
# amount.
