Scripts to interact with [Crabada](https://www.crabada.com)'s smart contracts ðŸ¦€

# ðŸ“£  Swimmer Network subnet

The bot now works on the Swimmer Network subnet!

Make sure to follow our [migration tutorial](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/discussions/104): it takes just a few minutes ðŸ™‚

# Features

- Automatically send crabs mining.
- Automatically reinforce mines & loots.
- Automatically claim rewards for mines & loots.
- Run the bot without human supervision.
- Manage multiple teams at the same time.
- Telegram notifications.

Reinforce-specific features:

- Choose between several reinforcement strategies.
- Self-reinforce from inventory.
- Do not reinforce if gas is too expensive.

# Quick start

1. Make sure you have Python 3.9 or later installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Copy _.env.example_ in _.env_.
4. Configure _.env_; the bot will only consider the teams you add there.
5. `cd` in the root folder of the project (the same where this readme is)
6. Run any of the scripts in the _bin_ folder, or, to set an automatic job, see the "Run without human supervision" section of this README.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not run the bot on a webserver! If you must do it, keep your _.env_ outside the public folder at all costs, otherwise your private key might be accessible via browser! For good measure, also restrict its permissions: `chmod 700 .env`.

# It doesn't work!

1. Please check if your issue is listed in the [Common issues page](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/wiki/Common-issues).
2. If not, please search in the [Discussions section](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/discussions/).
3. If even that does not help, consider [asking the community](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/discussions/new) ðŸ™‚

# Mining scripts

- Run `python -m bin.mining.sendTeamsMining <your address>` to send available teams mining.
- Run `python -m bin.mining.closeMines <your address>` to close and claim rewards on finished mines.
- Run `python -m bin.mining.reinforceDefense <your address>` to reinforce all open mines with a crab from the tavern, using the reinforcement strategy specified in the .env file.

# Looting scripts

- Run `python -m bin.looting.reinforceAttack <your address>` to reinforce all attacking teams with a crab from the tavern, using the reinforcement strategy specified in the .env file.
- Run `python -m bin.looting.closeLoots <your address>` to settle and claim rewards on loots that can be settled.
- Run `python -m bin.looting.notifyTeamsIdle <your address>` to notify when the looting teams are sitting idle and they are waiting to be manually sent to loot

### - What about attacking? ðŸ¤”

The bot can only help looters with automatic reinforcement & settling.

I have no plans to implement automatic looting/attacking [for the reasons outlined here](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/issues/3#issuecomment-1073066318).

# Run without human supervision

In order to run the bot without human supervision, you'll need to set a cron job.

I would recommend to do it on a remote server, for example on Vultr, AWS or Google Cloud; if you can't be bothered, you can also do it on your computer: just make sure you keep the computer turned on all the time.

### - Linux & Mac instructions

Follow these instructions to send all available teams mining & to collect rewards for you:

1. Find the path of Python 3 in your system by running `which python3` or `which python`.
2. Open crontab > `env EDITOR=nano crontab -e`
3. Insert the following lines:
    ```
    0,30 * * * * cd $HOME/crabada.py && /path/to/python3 -m bin.mining.sendTeamsMining <your address>
    15,45 * * * * cd $HOME/crabada.py && /path/to/python3 -m bin.mining.closeMines <your address>
    ```
3. Customize with the path to Python 3 (`/path/to/python3`), the path to the script folder (`$HOME/crabada.py`) and your wallet address (`<your address>`).
4. The cron job will run twice every 30 minutes. Feel free to change the frequency, if in doubt see [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/).
5. If you want to reinforce defense too, just add another line to run `bin.mining.reinforceDefense`, for example:
   ```
   2,12,22,32,42,52 * * * * cd $HOME/crabada.py && python -m bin.mining.reinforceDefense <your address>
   ```

# Reinforce Strategies

Crabada can be played in different ways, especially when it comes to reinforcing.

Choose the strategy to use with the `USER_X_TEAM_Y_REINFORCE_STRATEGY` parameter in *.env*:

| Name | Description | Notes | Credits |
| ---  | ---         | ---   | ---     |
| `NoReinforce`              | Do not reinforce | Useful to spare gas | |
| `HighestBp`                | Highest-BP low-cost crab | Good for looting on a budget | |
| `HighestMp`                | Highest-MP low-cost crab | Good for mining on a budget | |
| `HighestBpHighCost`        | Highest-BP crab | Use with high max price | @coinmasterlisting |
| `HighestMpHighCost`        | Highest-MP crab | Use with high max price | @coinmasterlisting |
| `CheapestCrab`             | Cheapest crab | Get a chance at mining revenge | |
| `HighestBpFromInventory`   | Highest-BP from the inventory | Use with a fallback strat | @yigitest |
| `HighestMpFromInventory`   | Highest-MP from the inventory | Use with a fallback strat | @yigitest |
| `FirstFromInventory`       | First available crab in the inventory | Use with a fallback strat | @yigitest |

### - Fallback strategies

Sometimes a strategy will not be able to find a suitable crab. For example, a high-cost strategy might return a crab that is too expensive for the user, or an inventory strategy might fail because thereÂ are no free crabs in the user's inventory.

To account for these cases, you can specify multiple strategies as comma-separated values. For example, if you specify:

```bash
USER_X_TEAM_Y_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestBpFromInventory, HighestBpHighCost, HighestBp"
```

Then, the bot will:

1. Attempt to self-reinforce with a high-BP crab from the user's inventory.
2. If there are no free crabs in the inventory, attempt to borrow the highest-BP crab in the tavern.
3. If the highest-BP crab is too expensive, attempt to borrow the highest-BP among the cheapest crabs in the tavern.

### - Avoid the competition

The `Highest` non-inventory strategies support the optional parameter `REINFORCEMENT_TO_PICK`. Set it to 2, 3, 4 to pick the 2nd, 3rd, 4th-best crab, and so on. Since most bots will compete for the first crab, setting this parameter to a higher-than-1 value can reduce the risk of a reverted transaction. Use this strategy if you constantly fail to get the first crab.

**Important**: No matter which strategy you choose, the bot will never borrow a crab that is more expensive than `REINFORCEMENT_MAX_PRICE`.

### - Create your own strategy

Creating a strategy is very simple:

1. Duplicate a strategy you like and pick a class name.
2. Customize the three methods in the class: `query()`, `process()` and `pick()`. 
3. Make sure your strategy never borrows crabs more expensive than `USER_X_REINFORCEMENT_MAX_PRICE`.
4. Add the strategy name to the list in the file *ReinforceStrategyFactory.py*
5. Configure _.env_ to use your new strategy via the `USER_X_TEAM_Y_REINFORCE_STRATEGY` parameter.

To **test the strategy** withouth sending transactions, use the *testMakeReinforceStrategy.py* script.

### - Gas control

Use the following parameters to set the maximum you are willing to spend for gas, in gwei:

- `USER_X_REINFORCEMENT_MAX_GAS` to reinforce,
- `USER_X_MINE_MAX_GAS` to send a team mining,
- `USER_X_CLOSE_MINE_MAX_GAS` to close a mine, and
- `USER_X_CLOSE_LOOT_MAX_GAS` to settle a loot.

If Avalanche's base fee is higher than that, the bot will not perform the action.

As a reference, when the base fee is 100 gwei, you will roughly spend 0.02 AVAX to reinforce or start a mine, and about half of that for the other actions.

# Support for multiple teams

The bot can handle multiple teams, you just need to register their IDs and strategies in the .env file:

```bash
# Team 1
USER_1_TEAM_1="1111"
USER_1_TEAM_1_TASK="mine"
USER_1_TEAM_1_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestMp"

# Team 2
USER_1_TEAM_2="2222"
USER_1_TEAM_2_TASK="loot"
USER_1_TEAM_2_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestBp"
```

Then, you can run any of the scripts described above and they will apply to all of the registered teams.

### - Team grouping

If you manage multiple teams and your _.env_ is becoming a mess, consider **grouping your teams** in the following way:

```bash
# Mining group
USER_1_GROUP_1_TEAMS="1111, 3333, 5555"
USER_1_GROUP_1_TASK="mine"
USER_1_GROUP_1_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestMp"

# Looting group
USER_1_GROUP_2_TEAMS="2222, 4444, 6666"
USER_1_GROUP_2_TASK="loot"
USER_1_GROUP_2_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestBp"
```

The above example will register 3 mining teamsÂ with the `HighestMp` strategy and 3 looting teams with the `HighestBp` strategy.

### - Team staggering

When reinforcing from the inventory, it is best to send teams at least 30 minutes apart, in order to make the most out of the [reduced cooldown-time of inventory crabs](https://docs.crabada.com/whitepaper/game-mechanics#activities-and-cooldowns).

You can achieve this by grouping teams in a _stagger group_:

```bash
USER_1_STAGGER_GROUP_1_TEAMS=2001,2002,2003
USER_1_STAGGER_DELAY=35 # optional
```

Teams in a stagger group will not be sent mining unless 35 minutes have passed since the start of the last mining expedition of the group.

Multiple stagger-groups are possible by incrementing the group number:

```bash
USER_1_STAGGER_GROUP_1_TEAMS = ...
USER_1_STAGGER_GROUP_2_TEAMS = ...
```

# System requirements

The bot requires Python 3.9; I have personally tested it on:

- **Mac Os 11 (Big Sur)** > Install python3 and pip3 with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) > `brew install python3`
- **Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)** > Install python3 and pip with apt-get > `apt-get install python3 pip git` ([more details here](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/issues/28#issuecomment-1082615253))

Users told me that they managed to run the bot on Ubuntu, too. Attempts have been made to run the bot on a Raspberry PI, too, but [without success](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/issues/28#issuecomment-1082613093).

# Telegram Notifications

The bot can send notifications to your phone on successful and unsuccessful commands (e.g. `sendTeamsMining`, `reinforceDefense`, `reinforceAttack`, etc). Follow these instructions for setup:

1. Open Telegram.
1. Enter `@Botfather` in the search tab and choose this bot.
2. Choose or type the `/start` command and send it.
3. Choose or type the `/newbot` command and send it. And follow Botfather's instructions.
4. Take a note of your token value e.g. `11112222:AAASBBBSDASD`. This is your `TELEGRAM_API_KEY`. And keep this private!
5. Enter `@your-newly-created-bot-name` in the search tab and choose this bot.
6. Choose or type the `/start` command and send it.
7. Enter `@username_to_id_bot` in the search tab and choose this bot.
8. Choose or type the `/start` command and send it.
9. Take a note of your ID e.g. `P.S. Your ID: 1122334455`. This is your `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.

Then, set your .env file:

1. set `NOTIFICATION_IM=1` and `TELEGRAM_ENABLE=1`
2. set `TELEGRAM_API_KEY` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
3. run `python3 -m src.tests.testSendIM`

If everything worked fine, you should receive a Telegram message on your newly created bot.
