Scripts to interact with [Crabada](https://www.crabada.com)'s smart contracts ü¶Ä

# Donate ‚ù§Ô∏è

Building and maintaining the bot requires time and passion: please consider expressing your gratitude by donating a small part of your rewards :-)

To donate, set the `DONATE_PERCENTAGE` parameter to a small value, for example `DONATE_PERCENTAGE=3%`; for more details, feel free to have a look in _.env.example_.

# Features

- Automatically send crabs mining.
- Automatically reinforce mines & loots.
- Automatically claim rewards for mines & loots.
- Run the bot without human supervision.
- Manage multiple teams at the same time.
- Telegram notifications.

Reinforce-specific features:

- Choose between several reinforcement strategies.
- Self-reinforce from inventory.
- Do not reinforce if gas is too expensive.

# Quick start

1. Make sure you have Python 3.9 or later installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Copy _.env.example_ in _.env_.
4. Configure _.env_; the bot will only consider the teams you add there.
5. `cd` in the root folder of the project (the same where this readme is)
6. Run any of the scripts in the _bin_ folder, or, to set an automatic job, see the "Run without human supervision" section of this README.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not run the bot on a webserver! If you must do it, keep your _.env_ outside the public folder at all costs, otherwise your private key might be accessible via browser! For good measure, also restrict its permissions: `chmod 700 .env`.

# It doesn't work!

# Mining scripts

- Run `python -m bin.mining.sendTeamsMining <your address>` to send available teams mining.
- Run `python -m bin.mining.closeMines <your address>` to close and claim rewards on finished mines.
- Run `python -m bin.mining.reinforceDefense <your address>` to reinforce all open mines with a crab from the tavern, using the reinforcement strategy specified in the .env file.

# Looting scripts

- Run `python -m bin.looting.reinforceAttack <your address>` to reinforce all attacking teams with a crab from the tavern, using the reinforcement strategy specified in the .env file.
- Run `python -m bin.looting.closeLoots <your address>` to settle and claim rewards on loots that can be settled.

### - What about attacking? ü§î

The bot can only help looters with automatic reinforcement & settling.

I have no plans to implement automatic looting/attacking [for the reasons outlined here](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/issues/3#issuecomment-1073066318).

# Run without human supervision

In order to run the bot without human supervision, you'll need to set a cron job.

I would recommend to do it on a remote server, for example on Vultr, AWS or Google Cloud; if you can't be bothered, you can also do it on your computer: just make sure you keep the computer turned on all the time.

### - Linux & Mac instructions

Follow these instructions to send all available teams mining & to collect rewards for you:

1. Find the path of Python 3 in your system by running `which python3` or `which python`.
2. Open crontab > `env EDITOR=nano crontab -e`
3. Insert the following lines:
    ```
    0,30 * * * * cd $HOME/crabada.py && /path/to/python3 -m bin.mining.sendTeamsMining <your address>
    15,45 * * * * cd $HOME/crabada.py && /path/to/python3 -m bin.mining.closeMines <your address>
    ```
3. Customize with the path to Python 3 (`/path/to/python3`), the path to the script folder (`$HOME/crabada.py`) and your wallet address (`<your address>`).
4. The cron job will run twice every 30 minutes. Feel free to change the frequency, if in doubt see [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/).
5. If you want to reinforce defense too, just add another line to run `bin.mining.reinforceDefense`, for example:
   ```
   2,12,22,32,42,52 * * * * cd $HOME/crabada.py && python -m bin.mining.reinforceDefense <your address>
   ```

# Reinforce Strategies

Crabada can be played in different ways, especially when it comes to reinforcing.

Choose the strategy to use with the `USER_X_TEAM_Y_REINFORCE_STRATEGY` parameter in *.env*:

| Name | Description | Notes | Credits |
| ---  | ---         | ---   | ---     |
| `NoReinforce`              | Do not reinforce | Useful to spare gas | |
| `HighestBp`                | Highest-BP low-cost crab | Good for looting on a budget | |
| `HighestMp`                | Highest-MP low-cost crab | Good for mining on a budget | |
| `HighestBpHighCost`        | Highest-BP crab | Use with high max price | @coinmasterlisting |
| `HighestMpHighCost`        | Highest-MP crab | Use with high max price | @coinmasterlisting |
| `CheapestCrab`             | Cheapest crab | Get a chance at mining revenge | |
| `HighestBpFromInventory`   | Highest-BP from the inventory | Use with a fallback strat | @yigitest |
| `HighestMpFromInventory`   | Highest-MP from the inventory | Use with a fallback strat | @yigitest |
| `FirstFromInventory`            | First available crab in the inventory | Use with a fallback strat | @yigitest |

### - Fallback strategies

Sometimes a strategy will not be able to find a suitable crab. For example, a high-cost strategy might return a crab that is too expensive for the user, or an inventory strategy might fail because there¬†are no free crabs in the user's inventory.

To account for these cases, you can specify multiple strategies as comma-separated values. For example, if you specify:

```bash
USER_X_TEAM_Y_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestBpFromInventory, HighestBpHighCost, HighestBp"
```

Then, the bot will:

1. Attempt to self-reinforce with a high-BP crab from the user's inventory.
2. If there are no free crabs in the inventory, attempt to borrow the highest-BP crab in the tavern.
3. If the highest-BP crab is too expensive, attempt to borrow the highest-BP among the cheapest crabs in the tavern.

### - Avoid the competition

The `Highest` non-inventory strategies support the optional parameter `REINFORCEMENT_TO_PICK`. Set it to 2, 3, 4 to pick the 2nd, 3rd, 4th-best crab, and so on. Since most bots will compete for the first crab, setting this parameter to a higher-than-1 value can reduce the risk of a reverted transaction. Use this strategy if you constantly fail to get the first crab.

**Important**: No matter which strategy you choose, the bot will never borrow a crab that is more expensive than `REINFORCEMENT_MAX_PRICE`.

### - Create your own strategy

Creating a strategy is very simple:

1. Duplicate a strategy you like and pick a class name.
2. Customize the three methods in the class: `query()`, `process()` and `pick()`. 
3. Make sure your strategy never borrows crabs more expensive than `USER_X_REINFORCEMENT_MAX_PRICE`.
4. Add the strategy name to the list in the file *ReinforceStrategyFactory.py*
5. Configure _.env_ to use your new strategy via the `USER_X_TEAM_Y_REINFORCE_STRATEGY` parameter.

To **test the strategy** withouth sending transactions, use the *testMakeReinforceStrategy.py* script.

### - Gas control

Use the `USER_X_REINFORCEMENT_MAX_GAS` parameter to set the maximum you are willing to spend for gas when reinforcing, in gwei.

If Avalanche's base fee is higher than that, the bot will not reinforce.

As a reference, when the base fee is 100 gwei, you will roughly spend 0.02 AVAX to reinforce.

# Support for multiple teams

The bot can handle multiple teams, you just need to register their IDs and strategies in the .env file:

```bash
# Team 1
USER_1_TEAM_1="1111"
USER_1_TEAM_1_TASK="mine"
USER_1_TEAM_1_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestMp"

# Team 2
USER_1_TEAM_2="2222"
USER_1_TEAM_2_TASK="loot"
USER_1_TEAM_2_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestBp"
```

Then, you can run any of the scripts described above and they will apply to all of the registered teams.

### - Team grouping

If you manage multiple teams and your _.env_ is becoming a mess, consider **grouping your teams** in the following way:

```bash
# Mining group
USER_1_GROUP_1_TEAMS="1111, 3333, 5555"
USER_1_GROUP_1_TASK="mine"
USER_1_GROUP_1_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestMp"

# Looting group
USER_1_GROUP_2_TEAMS="2222, 4444, 6666"
USER_1_GROUP_2_TASK="loot"
USER_1_GROUP_2_REINFORCE_STRATEGY="HighestBp"
```

The above example will register 3 mining teams¬†with the `HighestMp` strategy and 3 looting teams with the `HighestBp` strategy.

# System requirements

The bot requires Python 3.9; I have personally tested it on:

- **Mac Os 11 (Big Sur)** > Install python3 and pip3 with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) > `brew install python3`
- **Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)** > Install python3 and pip with apt-get > `apt-get install python3 pip git` ([more details here](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/issues/28#issuecomment-1082615253))

Users told me that they managed to run the bot on Ubuntu, too. Attempts have been made to run the bot on a Raspberry PI, too, but [without success](https://github.com/coccoinomane/crabada.py/issues/28#issuecomment-1082613093).

# Telegram Notifications

The bot can send notifications to your phone on successful and unsuccessful commands (e.g. `sendTeamsMining`, `reinforceDefense`, `reinforceAttack`, etc). Follow these instructions for setup:

1. Open Telegram.
1. Enter `@Botfather` in the search tab and choose this bot.
2. Choose or type the `/start` command and send it.
3. Choose or type the `/newbot` command and send it. And follow Botfather's instructions.
4. Take a note of your token value e.g. `11112222:AAASBBBSDASD`. This is your `TELEGRAM_API_KEY`. And keep this private!
5. Enter `@your-newly-created-bot-name` in the search tab and choose this bot.
6. Choose or type the `/start` command and send it.
7. Enter `@username_to_id_bot` in the search tab and choose this bot.
8. Choose or type the `/start` command and send it.
9. Take a note of your ID e.g. `P.S. Your ID: 1122334455`. This is your `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.

Then, set your .env file:

1. set `NOTIFICATION_IM=1` and `TELEGRAM_ENABLE=1`
2. set `TELEGRAM_API_KEY` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
3. run `python3 -m src.tests.testSendIM`

If everything worked fine, you should receive a Telegram message on your newly created bot.

Note : Individual types of notifications can be toggled on or off by setting the following to 1 or 0:
`NOTIFICATION_SEND`, `NOTIFICATION_REINFORCE`, `NOTIFICATION_CLOSE` and `NOTIFICATION_NOTIFY_IDLE`.
